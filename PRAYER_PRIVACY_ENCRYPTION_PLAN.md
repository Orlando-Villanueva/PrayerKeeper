# Implementation Plan: End-to-End Encryption with User-Derived Keys

## Phase 1: Setup and Dependencies

1. Add encryption libraries to the project:
   - Install CryptoJS or another suitable encryption library
   - Update package.json dependencies and lock files

2. Create a dedicated encryption utility module:
   - Define encryption/decryption functions
   - Implement key derivation functions using PBKDF2
   - Create secure salt generation and storage mechanisms

## Phase 2: Authentication Flow Enhancement

1. Modify the authentication process:
   - Update login/signup flows to generate encryption keys after authentication
   - Store derived encryption key securely in memory during the session
   - Never persist the encryption key to permanent storage

2. Create a secure key derivation system:
   - Generate a unique salt for each user and store it in Supabase
   - Implement PBKDF2 with sufficient iterations (100,000+) for key stretching
   - Generate a strong AES-256 key from the user's password

## Phase 3: Data Model Updates

1. Update prayer data model:
   - Add fields for encrypted content and initialization vectors (IVs)
   - Modify database schema to accommodate encrypted data
   - Create migration strategy for existing prayers

2. Implement data migration process:
   - Create a one-time migration utility for existing prayers
   - Encrypt all unencrypted prayers during user login
   - Track migration progress to handle interrupted migrations

## Phase 4: Prayer Store Modifications

1. Update the prayer store operations:
   - Modify create/update functions to encrypt data before storage
   - Update retrieval functions to decrypt data after fetching
   - Handle encryption key availability checks

2. Add encryption layer to API interactions:
   - Modify all functions that send prayer data to Supabase
   - Implement just-in-time decryption when displaying prayers
   - Update search functionality to handle encrypted content

## Phase 5: UI Updates and Error Handling

1. Update prayer components:
   - Modify PrayerModal for handling encrypted content
   - Update Dashboard to work with encrypted prayers
   - Create loading states for encryption/decryption processes

2. Implement robust error handling:
   - Add graceful handling for decryption failures
   - Create user-friendly error messages for encryption issues
   - Implement retry mechanisms for failed operations

## Phase 6: Testing and Deployment

1. Comprehensive testing:
   - Test encryption/decryption with various content types and sizes
   - Verify data integrity across sessions
   - Performance testing with large datasets

2. Phased deployment:
   - Deploy encryption utility first
   - Roll out data migration in batches
   - Monitor for any issues with encrypted data retrieval

## Phase 7: User Education and Support

1. Create user documentation:
   - Explain the privacy benefits of encryption
   - Highlight any limitations (like reduced search capabilities)
   - Provide FAQ on the encryption implementation

2. Implement recovery options:
   - Create password reset flow that preserves data access
   - Add warnings about data loss if password is forgotten
   - Consider optional recovery mechanisms
